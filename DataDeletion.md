I am developing the app. Once completed and ready for distribution the app will contain a delet account feature. Its irritating that the play store is asking this upfront before devs can test and improve their app. I am trying to test the monetization part and subscription part and it wont allow unless I provide a url to do the same. I checked most othe rapps and I couldnt find a url which does that.
